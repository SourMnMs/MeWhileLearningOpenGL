## Be advised, **this currently only runs on Ubuntu**.

Uhhh there isn't much to say about this project right now.  
I'm making it for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)'s Campfire Flagship event.

I'm working on it in an effort to better understand the nitty-gritty of graphical design (using OpenGL in C++).  
The end goal is to have a working program that can calculate the area of a given shape.

## Checklist (mostly for myself):

- [x] Make it through [LearnOpenGL.com](http://LearnOpenGL.com)’s “Getting Started” tutorials
  - [x] Read through some of the other tutorials on there as well (not all of them because I’m making a 2D project)
- [ ] Make it easier to render shapes  
  - [x] Make generic shape class (and subclasses)
    - [x] Regular polygon of n sides
    - [ ] Triangle  
    - [ ] Rectangle  
  - [x] Make a handler to operate on all of its given shapes
    - [x] Buffer shapes
    - [x] Render shapes
    - [ ] Input buffer  
- [ ] More stuff to come  
- [ ] Area Calculator
